## {{< fa brands github title="The GitHub Octocat" >}} Build & publish your website using GitHub Pages {#github-pages}

There are a [lots of options to publish your website](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/). Weâ€™ll use the [GitHub Pages option](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html), which allows you to publish a website from any GitHub repository. To do so, there are a few configuration steps:

1.  **Create a file named `.nojekyll` in your repository's root directory (e.g. `OHI-methods-EXAMPLE/`)**, which is required to disable some processing of HTML files that GitHub does by default. There are two ways you can do this: 

    a. In your RStudio **Terminal**, type the following command:
    
    ```{bash}
#| eval: false
touch .nojekyll
```

    b. From RStudio's **File pane**, click **New Blank File** > **Text File**, then type in `.nojekyll`.

## **Creating "non-standard" file types in RStudio (like a `.nojekyll` file)**

The `touch` command can be used to create a new, empty file from the command line. Similarly, RStudio's **Text File** button allows you to define and create any file type. Since there's no default button in RStudio for creating a `.nojekyll` file, you'll want to use one of these two approaches.

`.nojekyll` is a *hidden* file which won't visibly appear in your directory. You *should* see it show up as a file to track with git (either under the **Git** tab in RStudio, or when you run `git status` in the command line). You can also view hidden files in Finder (Mac) using the keyboard shortcut `Command` + `Shift` + `.`, or follow [these instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hidden-files-0320fe58-0117-fd59-6851-9b7f9840fdb2) for Windows 10, 8.1, and 7.

2.  **Set the `output-dir` in your `_quarto.yml` file to `docs`** (it's easiest to open and edit this from RStudio):

```{r filename="_quarto.yml"}
#| eval: false
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
  
# ~ additional metadata excluded for brevity ~
```

::: {.callout-note collapse=true}
## **Your rendered website pages will be saved to `output-dir` (here, that's the `docs/` folder)**
The `output-dir` is the directory (i.e. folder) where your rendered `.html` (and other important) files will automatically be saved to when you "Build" your website (see the next step!) -- that is, when you convert all your `.qmd` files to the `.html` files that your web browser can interpret / display. 
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## **You can delete `_site/` if it exists and if you're publishing with GitHub Pages**
If you previewed or built your site *before* setting `output-dir` to `docs` in `_quarto.yml`, you'll notice a `_site/` directory inside your repository -- this is the default output directory name. Because GitHub Pages will expect a `docs/` folder to deploy from, you can delete `_site/` altogether (and push your deletion, if you've already committed / pushed `_site/` to GitHub).
:::

3.  **Build / render your website.** Click on the **Build** tab (top left pane in RStudio if you have the default layout), then **Render Website** (alternatively, you can run `quarto render` in the Terminal) -- this command creates the final version of your website documents for deployment. Once rendered, you should see your soon-to-be website appear in the **Viewer** tab. 

<!-- Click on the <img src="media/view_in_browser.png" alt="A browser window overlaid by an arrow pointing up and angled to the right." style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 0px; width:25px;height:20px;"/> button to open your file in your web browser. **Note:** your website is currently being hosted by your local machine, not at a searchable URL. We'll get there soon though! -->

::: {.callout-tip}
## **Close / reopen your project if the Build tab is missing**

If you don't see the **Build** tab, close then reopen your project. It should appear!

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("media/build-tab.png")
```
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## **You MUST render your website before pushing your files to GitHub!**

Clicking **Render Website** in the Build tab (or running `quarto render` in the Terminal) is a necessary pre-(re)deployment step -- it converts all `.qmd` files to `.html` and ensures that all website components are stitched together correctly. If you do not render your website before pushing your files, your changes will not deploy.
:::

4.  **Send all of your website files from your local git repository to your remote GitHub repository:** 

    a.  **Stage** your files by checking all the boxes in the **Git** tab (*this is analogous to the `git add .` command used in the Terminal for staging all files*)
    b.  **Commit** your files by clicking the Commit button, adding a commit message, and clicking "Commit" (*analogous to `git commit -m "my commit message"`*)
    c.  **Push** your files to the remote repository (on GitHub) by clicking the "Push" button with the green upward facing arrow (*analogous to `git push`*).

5.  **Configure GitHub pages to serve content from the "docs" directory** by clicking on the **Settings** tab in the top menu bar, then the **Pages** tab from the left-hand menu bar. Make sure that **Branch** is set to `main` and that the selected folder is set to `/docs`. Click **Save**. Once deployed (this may take a few minutes), your website's URL will appear inside a box at the top of the page (you may have to try refreshing a few times). 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: page
#| fig-subcap: 
#|  - "Your website's URL will appear at the top of the page once you've configured GitHub pages to host your Quarto site"
#|  - "A hosted Quarto website! Now time to customize and add content."
knitr::include_graphics("media/gh-pages.png")
knitr::include_graphics("media/deployed-site.png")
```


::: {.callout-tip}
## **Check out the *Actions* tab on GitHub to view deployment status**

See deployment status, time of each deployment, and how long it took to deploy each run. You can also find failed deployments here (yes, it does happen on occasion) and take action on fixing them.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("media/actions-tab.png")
```

You're now ready to continue iterating on your website and redeploy with ease! Your workflow will look something like this: 

1. Make updates to your website in RStudio (or IDE / text editor of choice)
2. Re-render your website by either (a) clicking **Render Website** in RStudio's Build tab, or (b) running `quarto render` in the Terminal
3. Push all of your files to GitHub where GitHub Pages will re-deploy your site with your latest changes
