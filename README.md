# Building Quarto websites for documenting Ocean Health Index (OHI) methods

This workshop is meant to introduce [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) as a tool and framework for building websites. It has been tailored (from it's [previous version](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/)) to serve [Ocean Health Index](https://oceanhealthindex.org/) (OHI) [fellows](https://oceanhealthindex.org/about/ohifellows/) in building websites to organize, house, and better share OHI methodology. It walks through the steps of creating the essential building blocks of any Quarto website, configuring website navigation menus, deploying a website (for free) using GitHub Pages, using Sass to update website fonts and colors, and a few other helpful tips and tricks.
